## Work Experience
### **SAS R&D Technical Intern** --- Summer of 2019
*SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.*
- Built text+image based deep learning models that predict (with super-human ability) the number of likes a potential social media post will receive.
- Developed statistical analytic tools for processing bulk visual and textual social media data.
- Created a multi-category sentiment classifier for text based on labels derived from Twitter emoji usage.
  - Gained experience with deep learning, pytorch, DenseNet, ELMO, BERT, YOLO, CAS, Python, and statistics.

### **IBM Technical Intern** --- Summer 2018
*International Business Machines Corp., Raleigh, NC.*
- Participated in an online MITx Quantum Information Science II course throughout the summer.
- Built a POC quantum algorithm language parser that allowed the use of quantum mathematical notation to program quantum simulations as part of an IBM hack-a-thon.
- Led a small intern team to develop a business data analysis and visualization app for viewing live insights of sales data.
  - Gained valuable leadership, project management, and teamwork skills, as well as further experience with cloud deployment, continuous integration, Python, pandas, Javascript/HTML/CSS, and data analysis

  - A novel deep learning model for identifying and tagging multiple overlapping patterns present in one-dimensional data, for the purposes of generating natural language descriptions

### **Co-founder and Developer** --- January 2017 – March 2018
*Backyard Ventures LLC, Raleigh, NC.*
- Created BeerMoney, an odd jobs marketplace for students, by students.
  - Developed the BeerMoney web app and backend server, gaining extensive experience with Elixir/Phoenix, Javascript/HTML/CSS, and SQL.

### **SAS R&D Technical Intern** --- Summers of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017
*SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.*
- Summer 2017: Studied quantum computing, and developed a method for evaluating, and calibrating artificial intelligence model probability outputs and their statistical accuracy. Began work on a second patent.
  - Gained experience with Quantum Computing, Bayesian statistics, deep learning probability calibration techniques, and more of the Python ecosystem
- Summer 2016 – January 2017: Patented a deep learning model I developed to learn insights from data for the purposes of generating natural language descriptions of the data.
  - Gained experience with deep learning, tensorflow, recurrent and convolutional neural networks, synthetic data generation, Elixir, and Python
- Summer 2015: Built a proof of concept extension of B.O.S.H. that extended its functionality from only deploying to cloud-based hardware to deploying to any hardware.
  - Gained experience with Go, Ruby, Git, deployment, unit testing, documentation, and analyzing open source project code
- Summer 2014: Prototyped cloud-based log collection/analysis tool with web GUI.
