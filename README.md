<div class="card" markdown="1">

## Summary

I am a software developer with a Master's degree in computer science and years of diverse experience in backend, frontend, deep learning, quantum computing, and entrepreneurship. I have a love for novel and innovative programming languages, like Rust and Elixir.

My work experience includes internships at Qualcomm, IBM, and five summers at SAS Institute. While at SAS, I gained experience with deep learning, data analysis, deployment technologies, and developed a deep learning patent. At IBM, I learned more about quantum computing and data visualization. At Qualcomm, I developed a DirectX ray tracing demo and analyzed its performance characteristics.
